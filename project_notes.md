# Extracting reference trees from arXiv documents

## Problem description and what we aim to solve

## Plan and what tools will be used

## Code description

Note: lots of bad referencing within the files. Perhaps arXiv files could be found by searching up author's names within arXiv's files. Supplemented by additional info (say publication year or whatever else can be found) it might prove to be reliable enough to supplement arXiv ID matching or DOI matching.
